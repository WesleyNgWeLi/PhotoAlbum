Instructions on how to execute application:
Run FinalProduct.exe
Input a positive integer
Program will output photo album and respective imageIds and titles.
Program will then ask if you would like to get another photo album. Y/y will loop the program again, any other input will result in the program exiting.

Notes:
JsonTest is the unit test for ImageModel class and deserializing json data.
ArgumentTest are the unit tests for the program's functions.
I coded this in VS2013 and it doesnt require special attention upon building the program. 
The instructions to build are Build->Build Solution.
